# wor library and runWor program

This is a private project used with other files to create a website with my own family tree.
It uses The Family Pack rec library and relies on certain conventions used in the database.

It is hoped that eventually this code will be incorporated into the main TFP project.

The build system is designed to be incorporated with, and complied with, the TPF build system.
If anyone is that interested in building it, then please drop me a line.
